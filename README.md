## Newcomer detected! Prepare to immerse yourself in the world of algorithms and syntax.ðŸ’»



Hey thereðŸ‘‹, I'm Muhammad. 

I'm a junior developer currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Sciences at FAST NUCES Lahore. Throughout my academic journey, I've undertaken multiple projects, which have made me comfortable with coding and navigating various computer technologies. I have experienced various technological transitions, from the era of Windows XP to witnessing the latest advancements in AI innovation.

How did I venture into the world of programming, one might ask?

- It's quite straightforward: when you've been using something for a long time, you naturally start wondering how it was created and how you can create something similar.

 - Mastering coding was a goal of mine to truly understand the world of computers. I wanted to be able to understand how devices work and how to solve their issues whenever I use them.
